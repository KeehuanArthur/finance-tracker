# üìù Notes Feature Documentation

## Overview

The Notes feature allows you to add, edit, and manage personal notes for individual transactions in your finance tracker. Notes are stored separately from your original CSV files, preserving the integrity of your source data while providing rich annotation capabilities.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Inline Editing**: Click directly in the notes column to add or edit notes
- **Auto-Save**: Notes are automatically saved when you finish editing
- **Persistent Storage**: Notes are stored in a separate JSON database file
- **Search Functionality**: Search through all your notes to find specific transactions
- **Backup & Recovery**: Create backups of your notes database
- **Statistics**: View statistics about your notes usage

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Data Storage
- **Original CSV Files**: Remain completely unchanged
- **Notes Database**: Stored in `data/notes_database.json`
- **Transaction IDs**: Unique identifiers generated from transaction data (date + amount + description + bank + source file)

### File Structure
```
data/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ notes_database.json          # Main notes storage
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ notes_backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json  # Backup files
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ chase/                       # Original CSV files (unchanged)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ apple_card/                  # Original CSV files (unchanged)

## üîß Technical Details

### Transaction ID Generation
Each transaction gets a unique ID based on:
- Transaction date
- Amount
- Description
- Bank name
- Source file name

This ensures consistent identification across app restarts while handling potential data changes.

### Notes Database Schema
```json
{
  "transaction_notes": {
    "abc123def456": "Your note text here",
    "xyz789uvw012": "Another note"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "version": "1.0",
    "created": "2025-01-26T22:00:00Z",
    "last_updated": "2025-01-26T22:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

### Column Configuration
- **Notes Column**: Editable text input, max 500 characters
- **Other Columns**: Read-only to prevent accidental data modification
- **Amount Column**: Formatted as currency, disabled for editing

## üõ°Ô∏è Data Safety

### Original Data Protection
- CSV files are never modified
- Notes are stored separately in JSON format
- Transaction matching uses multiple fields for reliability

### Backup Strategy
- Manual backup creation via UI
- Atomic file writes prevent corruption
- File locking prevents concurrent access issues

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of missing notes database
- Automatic database creation on first use
- Transaction ID collision resolution

## üéØ Best Practices

### Note Writing Tips
- Keep notes concise but descriptive
- Use consistent formatting for similar transaction types
- Include context that might be useful later (e.g., "Business expense - Client dinner")

### Organization
- Use the search feature to find transactions by note content
- Create regular backups, especially before major data changes
- Review notes periodically to ensure they're still relevant

### Performance
- The system handles thousands of transactions efficiently
- Notes are loaded on-demand to minimize memory usage
- Search is performed in-memory for fast results

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Notes not saving:**
- Check that the data folder is writable
- Ensure you're clicking outside the cell after editing
- Look for error messages in the Streamlit interface

**Notes disappeared:**
- Check if the notes database file exists in the data folder
- Verify that transaction data hasn't changed significantly
- Restore from a backup if available

**Performance issues:**
- Large numbers of notes (>10,000) may slow down the interface
- Consider archiving old transactions if performance degrades
- Use the search feature instead of scrolling through large datasets

### File Permissions
Ensure the application has read/write access to:
- `data/notes_database.json`
- The entire `data/` directory for backups

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

Potential improvements being considered:
- Rich text formatting in notes
- Note categories and tags
- Export notes to CSV/Excel
- Note history and versioning
- Collaborative notes for shared accounts
- AI-powered note suggestions

## üìä Example Usage

### Sample Notes
```
"Whole Foods grocery run - organic produce"
"Gas station - road trip to Portland"
"Coffee shop - meeting with client"
"Amazon - office supplies for home office"
"Restaurant - anniversary dinner"
```

### Search Examples
- Search "client" to find business-related expenses
- Search "grocery" to review food spending
- Search "office" to track work-related purchases
